1.2 Data Transmission

1.2.1 Video - Types of Personal Data
- Media player component.
- Play the video to explore types of personal data.

1.2.2 The Bit
- Computers and networks operate with binary digits (bits), 0 or 1.
- Bits are the smallest unit of data, representing discrete states.
- Computers interpret patterns of bits; humans interpret words and pictures.
- Binary representation involves discrete states in physical systems.
- Input devices translate human interaction into binary code; output devices translate binary data back.
- Data is processed and stored as binary within the computer.
- ASCII code is commonly used, where each character is represented by eight bits (byte).
  - Examples: A = 01000001, 9 = 00111001, # = 00100011.
- Codes represent various types of digital information, including data, graphics, photos, voice, video, and music.

1.2.3 Common Methods of Data Transmission
- Data, transformed into bits, must be converted into signals for network transmission.
- Media refers to the physical medium (copper wire, fiber-optic cable, electromagnetic waves) on which signals are transmitted.
- Signals consist of electrical or optical patterns representing digital bits and travel across media.
- Three common methods of signal transmission:
  - Electrical signals: Data represented as electrical pulses on copper wire.
  - Optical signals: Conversion of electrical signals into light pulses.
  - Wireless signals: Transmission using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
- Network signals in homes/small businesses: Copper wires or Wi-Fi; larger networks use fiber-optic cables.
