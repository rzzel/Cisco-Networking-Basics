1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput

1.3.1 Bandwidth
- Streaming movies or playing multiplayer games requires high bandwidth.
- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data, measured in bits per second (bps).
- Common units: Kbps (Thousands of bps), Mbps (Millions of bps), Gbps (Billions of bps), Tbps (Trillions of bps).
- Physical media properties, current technologies, and physics determine available bandwidth.

1.3.2 Throughput
- Throughput measures the transfer of bits across the media over time.
- Factors influencing throughput: amount and types of data, latency created by network devices.
- Latency is the time, including delays, for data to travel from one point to another.
- Throughput doesn't consider the validity or usefulness of transmitted bits.
- Throughput can't exceed the slowest link in the path from sender to receiver.
- Online speed tests reveal internet connection throughput.

1.3.3 Video - Throughput
- Media player component.
- Play the video to understand more about throughput.
