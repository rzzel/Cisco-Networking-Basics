2.1.2 Client and Server Roles
- Hosts participate in network communication.
- Hosts can be clients, servers, or both.
- Computer software determines the role (client/server).
- Servers provide information to other hosts.
- Clients request and display information obtained from servers.

2.1.3 Peer-to-Peer Networks

- Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks: hosts act as both clients and servers.
- Small businesses and homes often use P2P networks.
- Advantages: easy setup, less complexity, lower cost.
- Disadvantages: no centralized administration, less secure, not scalable.

2.1.4 Peer-to-Peer Applications

- P2P applications: each device acts as both client and server.
- Hybrid systems use centralized directories for resource indexes.
- Example: Instant Message application.

2.1.5 Multiple Roles in the Network

- A computer with server software can serve multiple clients.
- A single computer can run multiple types of server software.
- Multiple client software can connect to multiple servers simultaneously.
